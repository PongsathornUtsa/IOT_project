## Project Requirements
1. It must display some variables for monitoring (humidity, temperature, pressure, velocity, distance etc.)
2. It should be able to control some hardware (use a slider, button, toggle to adjust some parameter or change system state, etc.)
3. It must compute something, ranging from some simple formula  to more complex algorithm such as FFT, PID, digital signal processing. Score is expected to depend on how challenging is your development.
4. The more advanced your IoT uses MCU resources (timer, processor cores) and coding techniques (ex. multitasking) , the more likely you'd score better on the project.

## Project Description
1. Monitoring Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, PM1, PM2.5, and PM10
2. Use Netpie IOT cloud platform, Netpie freeboard
3. Commands for EEPROM, Wi-fi, MQTT, OLED

## Hardware & Sodtware
### Hardware
1. NodeMCU esp8266
2. bme280, pms7003 sensors
3. button, wires, resistor
4. OLED(ssd1306)
5. I upgraded my project with esp32 for Multitsaking
### Software
1. Arduino IDE
